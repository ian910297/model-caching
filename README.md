## Overview
The purpose of this project is to observe the cache efficiency between two different network architecture. The first one (Fig.1) is a centralize controller to store cache information and manage serval nodes. If nodes send a request to the controller, it would transmit the necessary part to nodes. The other one (Fig.2) is still a centralize architecture, but nodes can communicate with each other. They have serval ways to send/recieve cache information. We would discuss these two situation in the future.
